        <h2>Transcript</h2>
        <p>Um, before I came to the possible zone, I kind of didn't see myself like doing anything big, you know, especially in like steam stuff. It all felt like it wasn't really for me. I mean, no one really told me I could be good at it. And honestly, I didn't think I'd have a future in anything like that. I didn't even believe I could like have a real career, let alone enjoy one. But after, you know, spending time here, it's different. I've built things I never thought I could build. I worked with people who actually listened to me, showed me how to do things and didn't make me feel dumb. Now I'm not as afraid of trying new stuff, especially things that seem hard or confusing at first. I still don't have everything figured out, but like now I actually believe I can do something.</p>
