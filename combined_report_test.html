        <h2>Competency Insights</h2>

        <div class="competency">
            <h3>Sense of Belonging</h3>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The student mentions growing up in Detroit, indicating a connection to their community.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> More information about current social or professional settings would be helpful to assess this competency fully.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I grew up in Detroit, which is primarily a blue collar town"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="competency">
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The student shows openness to different opportunities and learning from experiences.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> More explicit statements about personal growth and development could strengthen this competency.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "keeping an open mind is maybe what I'm hearing from you. No, definitely."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="competency">
            <h3>Adaptability</h3>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The student demonstrates flexibility in considering different career paths and opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> More specific examples of adapting to new situations would be beneficial.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "being open to opportunities that you might not have thought of"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="competency">
            <h3>Opportunity Recognition</h3>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The student shows a strong awareness of recognizing and seizing opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> Developing strategies for systematically identifying opportunities could enhance this competency.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "And really honing your intuition to recognize those opportunities when they come along because something really good might pass you by."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="competency">
            <h3>Persistence</h3>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The student implies persistence in pursuing their goals despite challenges.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> More explicit examples of overcoming obstacles would strengthen this competency.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "That's the one thing where it's like, nope, this is my one oppo[rtunity]"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Note: For the remaining competencies, there isn't enough information in the transcript to make substantive comments. -->

    </section>

    <section id="overall-assessment">
        <h2>Overall Assessment</h2>
        <p>Based on the limited transcript provided, the student demonstrates strengths in adaptability, opportunity recognition, and a growth mindset. They show an understanding of the importance of being open to various opportunities and the ability to recognize them when they arise. The student also exhibits a connection to their background, which could indicate a sense of belonging, though more information would be needed to fully assess this.</p>
        <p>Areas for potential improvement include providing more concrete examples of problem-solving, teamwork, and specific STEAM interests or skills. The transcript doesn't provide enough information to assess many of the competencies thoroughly, such as creativity, communication, STEAM agency, self-efficacy, continuous learning, and social capital.</p>
        <p>To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the student's competency development, additional information and examples would be necessary, particularly in areas related to STEAM interests, specific problem-solving experiences, and instances of applying creativity or working in team settings.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Overall Assessment</h2>
    <p>Based on the limited transcript provided, the individual demonstrates strong self-efficacy, persistence, and a clear sense of personal direction. These qualities are particularly evident in their commitment to pursuing their goals and their willingness to make decisions that align with their vision for their life.</p>
    <p>However, there are areas where further development could be beneficial. The strong focus on personal goals, while admirable, may limit adaptability and the ability to recognize diverse opportunities. Developing a more flexible approach while maintaining core values could enhance overall competency.</p>
    <p>The transcript does not provide sufficient information to assess many of the other competencies listed, such as STEAM Interest, Creativity, Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving, STEAM Agency, Continuous Learning, and Social Capital. A more comprehensive evaluation would require additional context and examples of the individual's experiences and behaviors in various settings.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while the individual shows strengths in self-direction and persistence, a more balanced approach that incorporates greater adaptability and openness to diverse opportunities could further enhance their overall competency development.</p>

        <h2>Overall Assessment</h2>
        <p>Based on the limited transcript provided, the student shows promising development in self-efficacy, growth mindset, adaptability, and opportunity recognition. These competencies are evident in their emphasis on personal responsibility for success and the ability to shape one's own work environment. However, the brief nature of the transcript limits our ability to assess many of the other competencies fully.</p>
        <p>To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the student's competency development, it would be beneficial to have a longer transcript or additional sources of information. This would allow for a more thorough analysis of all listed competencies, including those that couldn't be meaningfully assessed from the given excerpt.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, the student could benefit from opportunities to articulate their thoughts on teamwork, problem-solving, and specific STEAM-related interests and experiences. Additionally, exploring situations that demonstrate persistence, creativity, and communication skills would provide a more rounded picture of their competency development.</p>

        <h2>Overall Assessment</h2>
        <p>Based on the limited transcript provided, the individual demonstrates strong competency development in several areas, particularly Growth Mindset, Adaptability, Opportunity Recognition, and Persistence. They show resilience in the face of job loss and an ability to quickly pivot to new opportunities. There's also evidence of STEAM Interest, particularly in gaming and VR technologies.</p>
        <p>However, the short nature of the transcript limits our ability to assess many of the other competencies listed. A more comprehensive evaluation would require additional information and examples of the individual's behaviors and experiences across various situations.</p>
