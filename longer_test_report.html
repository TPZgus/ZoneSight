        <h2>Transcript</h2>
        <p>Yeah, so there was this one project we did where we had to, like, come up with our own idea for something and then actually make it. I was super into this idea of designing a sneaker with, like, sensors in it. Not because I knew what I was doing, honestly, I didn't even know where to start. But the idea just sounded cool, right? Anyway, we had to sketch it out, figure out how it'd work, and then use the 3D printer to make a prototype. I had never touched a 3D printer in my life, I thought I'd, like, break it or something. But the thing is, once we started messing around with it, I kind of got into it. Like, when the first print didn't come out right, I thought, okay, maybe I can tweak this a bit. I'd go back and fix the design, then try it again. That back and forth was kind of fun, even when it didn't go the way I wanted at first. I'm not saying it was easy or anything, but, like, when I finally got it right and had this sneaker in my hand that I made, that was a moment, you know? It was the same thing with coding. I wasn't into it at first because it seemed so boring, but then, when we were working on making this app, nothing crazy, just something simple, I realized I kind of liked the challenge of figuring out why something wasn't working, and then, like, piecing it together. I remember this one part of the code just wouldn't do what it was supposed to, and I spent forever on it, getting frustrated, but when it finally worked, I don't know, I didn't expect to care that much, but it was like, oh, I can do this. I guess that's what I liked about the projects. They weren't just about getting it right, but more about trying stuff out, seeing what sticks and then fixing what doesn't. It wasn't this huge pressure to be perfect, and that made me want to keep going with it.</p>

            <h3>Overall Assessment</h3>
            <p>The student demonstrates significant growth across multiple competencies, particularly in Growth Mindset, STEAM Interest, Problem Solving, and Persistence. They show a strong ability to adapt to new challenges, learn from failures, and persist through difficulties. Their self-efficacy and STEAM agency have noticeably improved through hands-on experience with technology and engineering concepts. While there's room for improvement in structured approaches to problem-solving and continuous learning, the student's overall trajectory is very positive. The project-based learning approach seems to have been particularly effective in fostering these competencies, allowing the student to engage with STEAM concepts in a meaningful and personally motivating way.</p>
